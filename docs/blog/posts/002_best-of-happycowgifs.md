# Video: Top 1000 posts of r/happycowgifs

Once upon a time, I stumbled accross a subreddit called r/happycowgifs, and I thought it would amazing to collate the top 1000 posts into one, long "watchable" video for everyones viewing pleasure.

Thanks to coding, I didn't have to spend ~~hours~~ days collating the videos together. With just the _perfect_ blend of PRAW (a Reddit API wrapper to gather data), Requests, Pandas, and MoviePy, I was able to brew up this 4.5 hour long compilation.

The video is complete with metadata for each GIF, and even a progress bar. Enough talk, here is the video!
