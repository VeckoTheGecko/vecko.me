As part of my Agile Web Development unit at university, we embarked on a journey to create a website where people could learn morse code. The result that Dean Law, Jonathan Choong, and myself came up with was Learn Morse. A website with flashcards, minigames, and user statistics that guides the user through learning morse code. Although the site isn't hosted, the source code is available in the linked repo, and a tour is available in the video to the right.
