Wanting to get more familiar with web-scraping tools like Beautiful Soup and Selenium, I embarked on the task of collating all the speeches of presidents Trump and Obama into single, "readable" PDF documents. Gathering the data, and then using the `docx` package, I was able create these resulting 5636 page and 2593 page PDFs for Trump and Obama respectively. The PDF documents come complete with a cover page and contents page.

The PDFs are located in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/VeckoTheGecko/presidential-speeches), perfect for a night of light reading!
