# Welcome to Vecko.me

Welcome to my website!! This website is all about maths, data science and computational modelling! My name is Nick, and this site is a place for me to share with others what I am learning as well as the projects I am working on.

# How did I build this site

I built this website by creating a custom Hugo template. The template also uses Bootstrap 5 for a lot of the layout, components and icons (I have come to find that I am bad at CSS). The bootstrap theming is customised through sass (which I learned through [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJKCj8uAHz8) allowing me to add [custom buttons](https://themightyprogrammer.dev/snippet/custom-bootstrap-button). The website also has LaTeX support (through KaTeX) for those beautiful equations 😍.

The designs for the website were mocked up using Figma

# Direction of this site

There are a few more features that I would like to implement in this site. In order of priority:

- Search engine optimisation
- Viewer comments (using uterances.js)
- Searching for posts (using Fuse.js most likely)

I want this website to be more than just a platform for me to air my ideas, I want this site to be a conversation! Learning is a task best done together. Feel free to suggest edits to posts either in the comments (when they are set up) or by using GitHub's pull requests.
