# The home of Vecko
Welcome to my website!! This website is all about maths and data science, and is to offer a place for me to share with others what I am learning as well as the projects I am working on.
More than that though, this is a conversation! Feel free to suggest edits to posts either in the comments (when they are set up) or by using GitHub's pull requests.
